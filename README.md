# Introduction to Algorithmic Adjoint Differentiation

In recent years, the computational cost of some mathematical operations in finance has increased every day due to the complexity of financial products or the models behind their valuation. In addition, the classical techniques (that is, finite differences) do not give us exact values of the derivatives but approximations of them.

For that reason, when reading about Adjoint Differentiation and its application to finance (mainly from Savine's work), we are interested in its previous results in terms of reducing the time and computational cost of calculating sensitivities.

The first objective was to understand the mathematics behind this technique and a first application (Dupire's Volatility Model), this objective was developed within a study group at the Faculty of Economics of the Universidad del Rosario during the second semester of 2022. Therefore, this repository contains the material (Videos and Slides of the sessions) used and produced at that time.

### Session 1

After a brief exposition of mathematical concepts, we introduce the term "adjoint" and its formula. Then we give a simple calculus example of the adjoints and its relation with the partial derivatives of a function.

### Session 2

We translate the calculus-type definitions of AAD into matrix-type definitions for Tangent and Adjoint modes to understand how algorithms should be developed, and give the example of this algorithms for a simple function. The codes for Tangent and Adjoint mode examples are FAD.ipynb and AAD.ipynb
