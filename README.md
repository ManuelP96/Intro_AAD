# Introduction to Algorithmic Adjoint Differentiation

In recent years, the computational cost of some mathematical operations in finance has increased every day due to the complexity of financial products or the models behind their valuation. In addition, the classical techniques (that is, finite differences) do not give us exact values of the derivatives but approximations of them.

For that reason, when reading about Adjoint Differentiation and its application to finance (mainly from Savine's work), we are interested in its previous results in terms of reducing the time and computational cost of calculating sensitivities.

The first objective was to understand the mathematics behind this technique and a first application (Dupire's Volatility Model), this objective was developed within a study group at the Faculty of Economics of the Universidad del Rosario during the second semester of 2022. Therefore, this repository contains the material (Videos and Slides of the sessions) used and produced at that time.
